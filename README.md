# Design Your House - Unity VR Project

"Design Your House" is a virtual reality game created by Pamela Cook of [LightBe Corp](https://www.lightbe.com/). This game allows someone to design their house by going through a series of rooms and making selections on different aspects of a house such as price range, number of bedrooms, etc. Waypoints are used to navigate around outside. The iTween 2.0.9 plugin is used for navigation inside the building. This game also includes two videos in two rooms inside the building, one a regular video and the other a 360 video.

To play: Follow the audio cues at the beginning. After you cross the street you have two choices. You can either go around the building to see the scenery or you can enter the building. Once you enter the building you can go into the Builder Info room to view a short video, go to the General Info room to watch 360 video clips or go into the House Selection Room to start selecting options to design your house. Be ready for suprises while you along the way.

This game was created using Unity 2017.4.0f1 and GoogleVR SDK 1.100.0 for iOS with the minimum version of 10.0. This project has been executed on an iPhone 6 Plus running the latest stable version of both iOS 11 and iOS 12.
